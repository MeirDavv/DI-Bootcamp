Question: Read about the PATH variable. Try to explain why you can call python3 if you arenâ€™t in the executable directory.

Answer: The shell has a variable named $PATH, using that variable it looks for programs so that even if we run a program not from it's current location in terminal, it still looks at that variable and looks for programs there and finally manage to open it.
