Question: Read about alias, and try to open a python console with the command:
$ py
'''
Answer:
You need to go to the terminal and run nano ~/.bash_profile (to edit the bash file)
Then at the bottom of the file, type: alias py='python3'
Then you can save by clicking 'ctrl'+'X' then press 'y' to confirm then press 'enter'
Now you  can run the command py (it will run python3)
