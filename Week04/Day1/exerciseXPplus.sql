-- Create a database called bootcamp.
-- Create a table called students.
-- Add the following columns:
-- id
-- last_name
-- first_name
-- birth_date
-- The id must be auto_incremented.

CREATE TABLE students (
	id serial primary key,
	last_name varchar(50),
	first_name varchar(50),
	birth_date date
);


-- Make sure to choose the correct data type for each column.
-- To help, here is the data that you will have to insert. (How do we insert a date to a table?)


-- Here is the data:

-- id	first_name	last_name	birth_date
-- 1	Marc	Benichou	02/11/1998
-- 2	Yoan	Cohen	03/12/2010
-- 3	Lea	Benichou	27/07/1987
-- 4	Amelia	Dux	07/04/1996
-- 5	David	Grez	14/06/2003
-- 6	Omer	Simpson	03/10/1980


-- Insert
-- Insert the data seen above to the students table. Find the most efficient way to insert the data.

INSERT INTO students (first_name,last_name,birth_date) VALUES
	('Marc', 'Benichou', '1998/11/02'),
	('Yoan', 'Cohen', '2010/12/03'),
	('Lea', 'Benichou', '1987/07/27'),
	('Amelia', 'Dux', '1997/04/07'),
	('David', 'Grez', '2003/06/14'),
	('Omer', 'Simpson', '1980/10/03');

-- Insert your last_name, first_name and birth_date to the students table (Take a look at the id given).

INSERT INTO students (first_name,last_name,birth_date) VALUES
	('Meir', 'Davidov', '2001/04/03');
