# Answer the following questions

# What is a class?

A class is a structure that allows us to create objects with the same properties and methods
'''
# What is an instance?

# What is encapsulation?
'''
Encapsulation is a wrapping of objects and methods inside a block which allows whats inside the block to stay private and not accessible by whats outside of it'''
# What is abstraction?

'''
# What is inheritance?
'''
Inheritence is the action which lets 1 class inherit properties and methods from another class
'''
# What is multiple inheritance?
'''
Multiple inheritence is when a class has 2 or more parents. So in that case the first parent is the main one which the child goes and ask for methods and properties from but in case a certain method or property doesnt exist in that parent class, it goes to the next parent
'''
# What is polymorphism?
'''
Polymorphism is when we have multiple classes with the same method name/ if these classes are seperate than each method works as expected without any interruption. If there is inheritence, the method in the childclass overrides the method from the parent class of the same method name, IF the method is applied on the child class element.'''
# What is method resolution order or MRO?
'''
Method Resolution Order is the order in which methods are being searched for and executed in the classes hierarchy. The order is from bottom to top and from left to right
