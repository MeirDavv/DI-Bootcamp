# üåü Exercise 1 : Pets
# Instructions
# Using this code:

    def __init__(self, animals):
        self.animals = animals

    def walk(self):
        for animal in self.animals:

# Create another cat breed named Siamese which inherits from the Cat class.

class Siamese (Cat):

    # Take all the cats for a walk, use the walk method.

    sara_pets.walk()


# üåü Exercise 2 : Dogs
# Instructions
# Create a class called Dog with the following attributes name, age, weight.
# Implement the following methods in the Dog class:
# bark: returns a string which states: ‚Äú<dog_name> is barking‚Äù.
# run_speed: returns the dogs running speed (weight/age*10).
# fight : takes a parameter which value is another Dog instance, called other_dog. This method returns a string stating which dog won the fight. The winner should be the dog with the higher run_speed x weight.

# Create 3 dogs and run them through your class.

    print(dog1.bark())
    print(dog2.run_speed())
    print(dog2.fight(dog3))


# üåü Exercise 3 : Dogs Domesticated
# Instructions
# Create a new python file and import your Dog class from the previous exercise.
# In the new python file, create a class named PetDog that inherits from Dog.
# Add an attribute called trained to the __init__ method, this attribute is a boolean and the value should be False by default.
# Add the following methods:
# train: prints the output of bark and switches the trained boolean to True

# play: takes a parameter which value is a few names of other Dog instances (use *args). The method should print the following string: ‚Äúdog_names all play together‚Äù.

# do_a_trick: If the dog is trained the method should print one of the following sentences at random:
# ‚Äúdog_name does a barrel roll‚Äù.
# ‚Äúdog_name stands on his back legs‚Äù.
# ‚Äúdog_name shakes your hand‚Äù.
# ‚Äúdog_name plays dead‚Äù.

# Exercise 4 : Family
# Instructions
# Create a class called Family and implement the following attributes:

# members: list of dictionaries
# last_name : (string)

# Implement the following methods:

# born: adds a child to the members list (use **kwargs), don‚Äôt forget to print a message congratulating the family.
# is_18: takes the name of a family member as a parameter and returns True if they are over 18 and False if not.
# family_presentation: a method that prints the family‚Äôs last name and all the members‚Äô details.

# Create an instance of the Family class, with the last name of your choice, and the below members. Then call all the methods you created in Point 2.

#     [
#         {'name':'Michael','age':35,'gender':'Male','is_child':False},

# Exercise 5 : TheIncredibles Family
# Instructions
# Create a class called TheIncredibles. This class should inherit from the Family class:
