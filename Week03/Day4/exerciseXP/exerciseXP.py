# üåü Exercise 1 ‚Äì Random Sentence Generator
# Instructions
# Description: In this exercise we will create a random sentence generator. We will do this by asking the user how long the sentence should be and then printing the generated sentence.

# Hint : The generated sentences do not have to make sense.

# Download this word list

# Save it in your development directory.

# Create a function called get_words_from_file. This function should read the file‚Äôs content and return the words as a collection. What is the correct data type to store the words?

import os

def get_words_from_file() -> list[str]:
    file_location = '/sowpods.txt'
    dir_path = os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__))
    file_path = dir_path  + file_location
    with open (file_path, mode='r') as file:
        content = file.read()
        lines = content.split('\n')

    return lines

# test:
# print(get_words_from_file())

# Create another function called get_random_sentence which takes a single parameter called length. The length parameter will be used to determine how many words the sentence should have. The function should:
# use the words list to get your random words.
# the amount of words should be the value of the length parameter.

# Take the random words and create a sentence (using a python method), the sentence should be lower case.

import random

def get_random_sentence(length : int) -> str:
    lines = get_words_from_file()
    sentence =''
    for i in range(length):
        word = random.choice(lines)
        sentence +=  ' ' + word

    return sentence.lower()

# test:
# print(get_random_sentence(3))

# Create a function called main which will:

# Print a message explaining what the program does.

# Ask the user how long they want the sentence to be. Acceptable values are: an integer between 2 and 20. Validate your data and test your validation!
# If the user inputs incorrect data, print an error message and end the program.
# If the user inputs correct data, run your code.

def main():
    program_explanation = '''
The program opens a txt file which contains words
Then it converts them into a list of words 
and finally it generates a sentence with given amount of words, that are picked randomly from the list
'''
    print(program_explanation)
    length = input("How long you want the generated sentence to be? (Acceptable values are: an integer between 2 and 20) ")
    try:
        length = int(length)
    except ValueError:
        raise ValueError("Int must be provided")
    if length < 2 or length > 20:
        raise ValueError("Number must be between 2 and 20!")
    else:
        print(get_random_sentence(int(length)))

    main()


# üåü Exercise 2: Working With JSON

# Access the nested ‚Äúsalary‚Äù key from the JSON-string above.

data = json.loads(sampleJson)
salary = data['company']['employee']['payable']['salary']
print(salary)

# Add a key called ‚Äúbirth_date‚Äù to the JSON-string at the same level as the ‚Äúname‚Äù key.

print(data)

# Save the dictionary as JSON to a file.
