Dear checker,
Our instructor Ziv recommended to do 1 exercise with Json and one with postgres.
I decided to make this one with postgres and not with json although what the exercise said, 
I will try to add even more functionalities that are not written in the exercise, for practice purposes.
Hope it's good, feel free to contact me if something needs a change ;)
Have an amazing day!
